# GoCalc
GoCalc is a simple calculator written in go that can parse Arithmetic Expressions.

# Interpreter Principle
GoCalc process begins with the Lexer that split the input (source code) into tokens. Then the parser takes those tokens and build an Abstract Syntax Tree out of them to finally evaluate their result into native type either boolean or integer type.

# REPL
At the end you may talk with GoCalc by typing some expressions using the interactive console.

This project is for educational purposes, don't be afraid and take a look inside it in order to learn how everything is done under the hood.
